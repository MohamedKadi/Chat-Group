Just wrapped up my first experiment combining sockets and threads in Java! 🎉 As a beginner, this was both challenging and exciting. I learned how to:

Handle multiple clients using threads 🧵
Use sockets for client-server communication 🌐
Manage I/O streams effectively 🔄
While it’s a simple mini-project, it’s a big step for me as I explore backend concepts and real-time communication.
